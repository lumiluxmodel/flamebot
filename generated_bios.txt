honestly just tryna figure out if wine or ice cream is a better companion these days 🤷‍♀️ got out of one of those “he's my everything” kinda situations and idk if i'm more heartbroken or free. tbh, kinda hoping to meet someone who’s into long talks about our favorite songs at 2am. if u scroll a little, maybe u’ll get a peek into my world.

so i might’ve packed up my life and moved to this city on a whim. lol classic me—always chasing vibes and new adventures. i'm lookin' for that thrill, like a spontaneous road trip or a rooftop sunset. not really sure what i’m doing but if u wanna join my chaos, look around a bit… u might stumble upon something interesting mid-profile.

being a hopeless romantic with a thing for bad boys is a whole mood, right? my friends say i give too many chances but maybe it’s just my way of finding love in unexpected places. still dreaming of those movie scene moments tho. if u’re curious, keep going and u might just see what i mean. maybe we’ll write our own story? ✨
